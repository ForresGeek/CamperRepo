Happy to answer any questions you may have before you come to look.

I'm located 2 miles outside Forres in the north of Scotland, approx 27 miles from Inverness, 12 miles from Elgin on A96. Van can be viewed by arrangement.


## Base Vehicle

+ VW Crafter CR35
+ Reflex Silver
+ 58,000 miles
+ 2.0l Diesel
+ MOT till June 2022
+ Full service history with [GLM Motors](https://www.glmmotors.net/) in Elgin

This model of Crafter is effectivley a Mercedes Sprinter with a VW engine. It shares **MOST** parts with a Sprinter of the same age. I bought many of the parts for this conversion from Mercedes commercials in Nairn.

## Camper

This camper was my project in 2014-2015, professionally converted by Neil @ Happy Highland Campervans in Inverness.

As a vehicle, it's the same length as a VW T5. It's based on the Crafter so it's a bit boxier, and there's more room internally (e.g. wider bed at 1.3m)

No-expense was spared during the creation of this van, but I'm not using it as much as I once did, so I'm selling this to help fund my next project.

This is the *LOW ROOF* - Me & the misssus are vertically challenged, so not a problem for us... If you're 6-foot-6 this is probably not the camper you're looking for.


Vehicle has very recent MOT, and will be serviced, and fully valeted before sale.

Van is registered with DVLA as _Motorcaravan_ therefore _CAR_ speed limits.
