## Base Vehicle

+ VW Crafter CR35
+ Reflex Silver
+ 58,000 miles
+ 2.0l Diesel
+ MOT till June 2022
+ Full service history with [GLM Motors](https://www.glmmotors.net/) in Elgin

This model of Crafter is effectivley a Mercedes Sprinter with a VW engine. It shares **MOST** pasrts with a Sprinter of the same age. I bhought many of the parts for this conversion from Mercedes commercials in Nairn.

## Camper

This camper was my project in 2014-2015, professionally converted bt Neil @ Happy Highland Campervans in Inverness.

As a vehicle, it's the same length as a VW T5. It's based on the Crafter so it's a bit boxier, and there's more room internally (e.g. wider bed at 1.3m)

No-expense was spared during the creation of this van, but I'm not using it as much as I once did, so I'm selling this to help fund my next project.

Vehicle as very recent MOT, amd will be serviced before sale.

Van is registered with DVLA as _Motorcaravan_ therefore _CAR_ speed limits.
